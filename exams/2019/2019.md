One of the ways to prevent CSRF attacks is to use CSRF tokens. How does this mechanism work?
Selecione uma ou mais opções de resposta:
- [ ] The CSRF token is stored as a session variable and is checked by the browser against a value sent by the server.
- [x] **The CSRF token is generated and stored on the server, sent to the browser inside the HTML code and resent to the server where it is checked.**

**CSRF**:
- Generate a random token per session

Consider the following string:
```
A groundhog would hog all the ground he could hog, if a groundhog could hog ground
```
For each one of the following regular expressions, copy the string and add square brackets around the first match. Don't change the string in any other way.
For example, if the regular expression first match is "hog all ", your answer would be:
```
A groundhog would [hog all ]the ground he could hog, if a groundhog could hog ground
```
If the regular expression doesn't have any match, answer with the original string with no modifications.

### Informação

Consider the following HTML code representing a tic-tac-toe game played between a human (browser) and a computer (server):

```html
<section id="tic-tac-toe" data-id="1234">
    <div class="square"></div>
    <div class="square"></div>
    <div class="square"></div>
    <div class="square">X</div>
    <div class="square">X</div>
    <div class="square">O</div>
    <div class="square"></div>
    <div class="square"></div>
    <div class="square">O</div>
    <p id="state">playing</p>
</section>
```
This same game would be shown, in the browser, to the human player as:

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tCkT4HZq/temp.png" alt="MarineGEO circle logo" style="height: 150px; width:130px;"/>

The human player uses the 'X' mark to play and the computer uses the 'O' mark. The human player is always the first to play.

Also, consider that the HTML document can contain other section, div, and p elements.
You do not need to consider any error conditions.

#### 26

Write the code needed for a PHP page (**play.php**) that receives the following POST parameters:
- id: The game id.
- position: An optional number, between 1 and 9, representing the move played by the human.

If the position parameter **has not been** received, the page should only return the current state (as returned by the state function defined below) of the game having the received id.

If the position parameter **has been** received, the page should execute the human move, execute the computer move and then return the current game state.
Consider that you have access to the following PHP functions in a file named **game.php**:

```php
- state($id): returns the game state for a given id. 
Example: array('state' => 'playing', 
'squares' => array ('', '', '', 'X', 'X', 'O', '', '', 'O'))
- play($id, $position): executes the human play received as a parameter
If the game hasn't ended yet, also executes a computer move.
```

The game state should be returned using JSON.

```php
include_once 'game.php'
```

#### 27

Write the JavaScript code needed so that when the page is loaded:
- The PHP script defined in the previous question is called, using Ajax, with the id parameter equal to the current game id (data-id attribute of the section with id 'tic-tac-toe').
- The HTML code is changed so that it reflects the state returned by that script (pieces and state).

You can consider that the script has been loaded using the defer attribute.
You can also consider that you have access to the following function:
```javascript
function encodeForAjax(data) {
    return Object.keys(data).map(function(k){
        return encodeURIComponent(k) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(data[k])
    }).join('&')
}
```

```javascript

```

#### 28

Write the JavaScript code needed so that when the human player clicks an empty square:
- The PHP script is called, using Ajax, with the id parameter equal to the current game id (data-id
attribute of the section with id 'tic-tac-toe') and the parameter position equal to the clicked
square number (from 1 to 9).
- The HTML code is changed so that it reflects the state returned by that script (pieces and
state).
You can, and should, use any functions defined in the previous question.

```javascript
```
